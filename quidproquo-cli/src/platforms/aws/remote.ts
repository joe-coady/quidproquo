// Build a backend service as a module-federation remote and publish it into the
// shared federated-code storage drive, under the service's own prefix. After this
// runs, the already-deployed lambdas load their stories from the bucket (quidproquo's
// dynamicModuleLoader tries the federated store first, falls back to the bundled
// code when nothing's published).
//
// The store is one storage drive shared across services (via `owner`). Each service
// opts in with defineFederatedModuleStore(<driveName>) and its lambdas read from
// s3://<bucket>/<service>. Read access comes from the storage drive's own grants, so
// the drive + a deploy of each service must exist before publishing. The bucket name
// resolves from the same service config the deploy used, so it always matches.
//
// Publishing is split into three phases so they can run as separate commands
// (publish:build / publish:upload / publish:deploy) or chained by `qpq publish`:
//   buildRemote          - rspack the remote + lay out service-remote-published/
//   uploadRemoteVersion  - sync the hashed version dir (everything BUT manifest.json)
//   deployRemoteManifest - upload manifest.json, atomically flipping lambdas over
// Version files always land before the manifest that references them, so a reading
// lambda never sees a manifest whose files aren't all present yet.
