# quidproquo-cli

The `qpq` command line tool: build, dev, and deploy orchestration for [quidproquo](https://github.com/qpqjs/quidproquo) apps.

An app scaffolded with `create-qpq-app` already depends on this and aliases the common commands in its npm scripts, so `npm run dev` and `npm run deploy` are the usual way in. Everything else you call as `qpq` directly.

```bash
npm install --save-dev quidproquo-cli
npx qpq
```

Running `qpq` with no command opens an interactive menu. Every command also takes `--app`, `--env`, and `--platform`.

## Commands

**Local development**

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `qpq go:dev` | Runs the full local stack, api and web, in one process |
| `qpq go:dev:api` | Just the api dev server, with hot reload |
| `qpq go:dev:web` | Just the views microfrontend dev servers |
| `qpq migrate [app]` | Runs pending migrations against the local dev store once, then exits |

**Deploying**

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `qpq go [svc] [stack]` | Deploys services. Interactive unless you pass the positional args |
| `qpq go:docker` | The same, but deploys in parallel via docker |
| `qpq synth [service]` | Synthesises the configs to `dist/apps/<app>/infrastructure` without deploying |
| `qpq teardown` | Destroys the web, api, and inf stacks for selected services |
| `qpq clear-resources` | Empties selected buckets and tables. Data only, stacks are untouched |

For `go`, `svc` is `all`, a comma-separated list, or one of `account`, `domain`, `bootstrap`. `stack` is `all`, `inf`, `api`, `web`, or `views`. A full `all all` or `all api` deploy also publishes federated backends.

**Federated remotes**

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `qpq publish` | Build, upload, and deploy federated remotes |
| `qpq publish:build` | Build them locally |
| `qpq publish:upload` | Upload the built version directories. Nothing goes live |
| `qpq publish:deploy` | Flip the manifests to the uploaded versions |

Splitting upload from deploy is what makes a rollback a manifest change rather than a redeploy.

**Workspace**

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `qpq prep` | Regenerates `apps/<app>/tsconfig.federated.json` |
| `qpq check:circular` | Scans workspace sources for circular imports. `--warn` to report without failing |
| `qpq hooks <name>` | Runs `qpq:<name>` in every app and package that defines it, dependency ordered and in parallel |

## Platforms

The target platform comes from your app's `deploy.config.json`, so the same commands work whichever one an environment uses. AWS and docker are supported today.

## Status

Pre-1.0. The whole `quidproquo-*` family releases in lockstep, so versions that share a number were built and tested together. Expect APIs to move between releases, and pin your versions.
