description: Commit currently staged changes with a package-prefixed message
---

Commit the changes that are currently staged in git. Do **not** stage anything yourself — work only with what's already in the index.

**Never ask the user a question.** This command usually runs headless in a terminal step (`claude -p '/commit'`) with nobody there to answer, so a question is a hang, not a checkpoint. There is no case where you pause for confirmation, offer options, or ask whether to do part of the work now or later. Every judgement call below has a stated default — take it, do the whole job, and note what you decided in the final report. The only permitted early exit is "nothing is staged".

## Steps

1. Run `git diff --cached --name-only` to get the list of staged files. If nothing is staged, stop and tell the user there is nothing to commit.
2. Run `git diff --cached` to read the actual staged changes so the message reflects what was done, not just which files changed.
3. **Check for breaking changes** (see "Breaking changes" section below). If the staged diff contains any, append a bullet for each to `breaking-changes.md` under the `## vNext` heading, then `git add breaking-changes.md` so it rides in this same commit.
4. **Check for fundamental changes that affect documentation** (see "Documentation updates" section below). If the staged diff adds or changes a documented action, config helper, or feature, create or update the relevant page(s) under `quidproquojs.com/docusaurus/docs/`, then `git add` those files by name so they ride in this same commit. Together with step 3, this is the **only** case in which this command is allowed to stage files beyond what was already staged by the user.
5. Determine the **prefix**:
   - For each staged file, take its top-level directory. If it starts with `quidproquo-`, that's the package.
   - Collect the unique set of packages touched.
   - **Exactly one package** → prefix is that package name with `quidproquo-` stripped, followed by `: `. Examples:
     - `quidproquo-core` → `core: `
     - `quidproquo-actionprocessor-node` → `actionprocessor-node: `
     - `quidproquo-webserver` → `webserver: `
   - **Two or more packages**, or changes only in root/tooling files → **no prefix**.
6. Write a **short, lowercase-leaning, human-sounding** summary of the change (1 line, ideally under ~70 chars). Match the terse style of recent commits like `text support for network request`, `stream json types`, `added disableReservedConcurrency to aws config`.
7. Run the commit:
   ```
   git commit -m "<prefix><summary>"
   ```
   Use `-m` with a single line. No body, no trailers.
8. Run `git status` after to confirm the commit landed, then report the commit message you used. If you appended to `breaking-changes.md` or touched any docs pages, mention those too (list the paths).

## Breaking changes

A breaking change is anything that forces downstream callers to update their code. In this monorepo that usually means:

- An exported function's signature changed (args added/removed/reshaped, return type narrowed).
- An exported type, interface, class, or enum had a required field added or a field removed/renamed.
- An exported symbol was removed or renamed.
- A `define*` config helper's shape changed in a way that existing config files won't compile against.
- Runtime behavior of a public API changed in a way a caller depends on (e.g. default value flipped, silent failure became a throw).

When you find one, append a bullet under the `## vNext` heading in `breaking-changes.md`. `vNext` is always the active bucket for unreleased breaking changes — at release time the user renames it to the release version and starts a fresh `## vNext` above it. Do not create or rename version headings yourself.

The bullet should:

- Be written for a **consumer** of the package, not for someone reading the internals. Say what they have to change in their own code to migrate — nothing more.
- State the old and new shape concretely (e.g. `foo(a, b)` → `foo({ a, b })`).
- Note the migration in one line if it isn't obvious.
- Stay terse — one dot point per change, no prose paragraphs.
- **Do not** mention internal mechanics (which helper the replacement delegates to under the hood, which resources it emits internally, refactor reasons, etc.) unless that detail is genuinely required for a caller to migrate.

If `breaking-changes.md` doesn't exist yet, or there is no `## vNext` heading, create it: a fresh `## vNext` heading goes above any existing version headings (or in a new file with just that heading). Never rename or renumber an existing version heading. Say in your final report that you added the heading.

Non-breaking additions (new exports, new optional fields, internal refactors that don't change any public shape) do **not** belong in `breaking-changes.md`.

## Documentation updates

The docs site lives at `quidproquojs.com/docusaurus/docs/`. It's a hand-written reference, one page per action requester or `define*` config helper, organized under `docs/actions/<layer>/<domain>/` and `docs/config/<layer>/<domain>.md` (`layer` is `core`, `webserver`, `features`, `xstate`, `neo4j`, or `config-aws`, matching the source package). The sidebar (`sidebars.ts`) autogenerates from this directory tree, so a new file in the right folder is all that's needed to appear in nav — no manual registration.

A staged change is **fundamental** (docs-worthy) when it does any of the following to something a consumer of a package would use:

- Adds a new exported action requester (an `ask*` generator in `quidproquo-core/src/actions/**` or an equivalent in another package's action layer).
- Adds a new exported `define*` config helper, or a new option on an existing one.
- Changes an existing documented action's or config helper's signature, parameters, defaults, return shape, or error enum.
- Changes documented runtime behavior (anything already described in prose on an existing page).
- Adds a genuinely new concept significant enough that `core-concepts.md`, `architecture-overview.md`, or `use-cases.md` no longer accurately describe the system.

It is **not** docs-worthy when the change is an internal refactor, a processor-only fix that doesn't change the action's public contract, a test change, or a bug fix that doesn't change already-documented behavior.

When you find a docs-worthy change:

1. **Read the real, current source before writing anything** — the action requester's generator signature, its option/param types, the processor's error enum, any JSDoc. Do not infer parameter names, types, defaults, or error names from the diff alone if the full file makes it ambiguous — open the file. Never invent or guess content; if you can't verify something from the code, leave it out rather than assume.
2. Find the matching page by the naming convention: action pages are named after the kebab-case of the function (`askNetworkRequest` → `ask-network-request.md`) inside a kebab-case domain folder (`keyValueStore` → `key-value-store/`); config pages are named after the kebab-case of the setting (`defineAi` → `ai.md`).
3. **Page already exists** → update only the sections that actually changed (`## Signature`, `## Parameters`, `## Returns`, `## Errors`, `## Notes`), keeping the existing prose style and structure intact.
4. **No page exists yet** (brand-new action/config) → first read 2–3 sibling pages in the same directory to match tone and structure exactly, then create a new page with the same shape: frontmatter (`title`, `description`), an intro paragraph, an `## Signature` code block, `## Parameters` (and any nested option-object tables), `## Returns`, `## Errors` (only if the action can throw a mapped error), `## Notes` for anything non-obvious, and `## Related` linking sibling pages. If the domain folder itself is new, copy the shape of a sibling `_category_.json` into it.
5. Stage the new/changed doc files explicitly by name — same rule as `breaking-changes.md`, never a broad `add`.
6. Write the docs **now**, in this commit, however large the surface turns out to be. A big new feature meaning a dozen-plus pages is not a reason to defer, split the work, or check in first — the docs ride with the code that introduced them.
7. If it's genuinely unclear whether a change rises to "fundamental," default to documenting it. If the right page or section isn't obvious from the naming convention, pick the closest match by domain, follow the sibling pages' structure, and note the choice in your final report.

## Hard rules

- **Never** ask the user anything, and never stop half-done waiting for a decision. Assume nobody is watching the terminal. Make the call, do all of it, report what you decided.
- **Never** add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer.
- **Never** mention Claude, AI, "generated by", or any attribution of authorship to a tool. The message must look like the user wrote it themselves.
- **Never** use `-A`, `add .`, or otherwise stage files. The exceptions are `breaking-changes.md` (step 3) and docs pages under `quidproquojs.com/docusaurus/docs/` (step 4) — stage those explicitly by name, nothing else.
- **Never** use `--no-verify` or skip hooks. If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue or report it — do not bypass.
- If the staged diff spans multiple packages but is clearly one logical change (e.g. a new action added across core + processors), still drop the prefix — the 2+ packages rule wins.
- Keep the message a single line. No multi-line body unless the user explicitly asks.

## Examples

- Staged: only files under `quidproquo-core/src/actions/network/` → `core: text support for network request`
- Staged: files under `quidproquo-actionprocessor-node/` only → `actionprocessor-node: handle empty response body`
- Staged: files in `quidproquo-core` and `quidproquo-actionprocessor-lambda` → `stream json types` (no prefix)
- Staged: only `package.json` and `package-lock.json` at the root → `bump: 0.0.624` (no package prefix)
