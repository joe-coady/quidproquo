---

Business logic in quidproquo is written as generator functions called **stories**. A story never calls the clock, the database, or the network directly. It yields a typed action describing what it wants, and the runtime hands that action to whichever implementation fits the platform it is running on.

The same story runs on AWS Lambda, in a Node process, in a browser, or against fixtures in a test, with no changes to the code.

```typescript
function* askGreet(name: string): AskResponse<string> {
  const now = yield* askDateNow();
  return `hello ${name}, it is ${now}`;
}
```

`askDateNow()` does not read the clock. It yields `{ type: '@quidproquo-core/Date/Now' }` and suspends, and the runtime resolves it and resumes the generator with the answer.

## Getting started

```bash
npx create-qpq-app myapp
cd myapp
npm run dev
```

That scaffolds a complete working app (five services, a local dev server, and a one-image docker deploy), installs it, builds it, and makes the first commit. `npm run dev` runs the backend and every frontend dev server in one process, so one ctrl+c stops everything.

The api comes up on `http://localhost:8080` and the web on `http://localhost:3080`. Check it is alive:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/shell/v1/health
# {"status":"healthy","service":"shell","checkedAt":"..."}
```

You need **Node.js 24 or newer**. Docker is only needed when you deploy, not for local dev.

<details>
<summary>Scaffolder options</summary>

```bash
npx create-qpq-app <app-name> [options]

--language <typescript|javascript>   skip the language prompt
--domain <domain>                    app domain (default: <app-name>.example.com)
--no-git                             skip git init
--no-install                         skip npm install
```

Pass `--language javascript` and you get the same app with type annotations stripped and JSX preserved, running on the same toolchain.

</details>

## How it works

Here is the health route the scaffolded app ships with:

```typescript
import { askDateNow, AskResponse, HTTPEvent, HTTPEventResponse, qpqWebServerUtils } from 'quidproquo';
import { dynamicRoute } from 'quidproquo-features';

export const health = dynamicRoute(
  ['GET', '/health'],
  function* healthCheck(event: HTTPEvent): AskResponse<HTTPEventResponse> {
    const checkedAt = yield* askDateNow();

    return qpqWebServerUtils.toJsonEventResponse({
      status: 'healthy',
      service: 'shell',
      checkedAt,
    });
  },
);
```

Locally the clock is answered by the dev server, in production by whatever platform you deployed to, and in a test by a fixed timestamp you supply. That is why every function you call from a story is named `ask*`: it is a request, it has an answer, and it must be called with `yield*`.

| Term | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **Action** | A plain, serializable object with a type and an optional payload |
| **Requester** | The `ask*` generator your story calls to yield an action |
| **Story** | A generator function composing requesters into business logic |
| **Processor** | The platform-specific function that actually performs an action |
| **Runtime** | The loop that runs a story, routes each yielded action to a processor, and logs the whole thing |

Three things fall out of that arrangement:

- **Tests need no infrastructure.** Mock actions by type and assert on the result.
  ```typescript
  const result = runStory(askGreet('world'), { [DateActionType.Now]: '2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z' });
  ```
- **Moving platforms is a config change.** The stories do not know or care which processor set answered them.
- **Every run leaves a complete log.** Because all side effects pass through the runtime, you get execution logs, replay, and statement-level traces without instrumenting anything. That is what the [admin console](https://github.com/qpqjs/quidproquo/tree/main/quidproquo-web-admin) reads.

The [ESLint plugin](https://github.com/qpqjs/quidproquo/tree/main/quidproquo-eslint-config) enforces both halves of the `ask` contract: always `yield*` an ask call, never name a plain function `ask*`.

## Working on the framework

The repo is an npm workspace. From the root:

```bash
npm install
npm run build          # build every package
npm run build:lite     # only what changed since the last build
npm run test           # vitest across the workspace
npm run lint           # eslint across the workspace
npm run validate       # lint, build, test, and typecheck the test suite
```

Target a single package with `-w`, for example `npm run watch -w quidproquo-core`.

Tests run on vitest and alias sibling packages to their `src`, so you do not need to build before running them.

## Status

Pre-1.0. The whole family releases in lockstep, so any set of `quidproquo-*` versions that share a number was built and tested together. Expect APIs to move between releases, and pin your versions.

## Documentation

Full docs, including the action reference, live at **[docs.quidproquojs.com](https://docs.quidproquojs.com)**. The site is built from [quidproquojs.com/docusaurus](https://github.com/qpqjs/quidproquo/tree/main/quidproquojs.com/docusaurus) in this repo, and the app around it is a real qpq workspace that doubles as the `create-qpq-app` template.
