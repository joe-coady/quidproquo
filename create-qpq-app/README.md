# create-qpq-app

Scaffold a new [quidproquo](https://github.com/qpqjs/quidproquo) app:

```bash
npx create-qpq-app my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

You get a full workspace with five services (`admin`, `auth`, `design`, `shell` and `todo`) that builds, runs locally on the qpq dev server, and deploys as a single docker image with `npm run deploy`.

The api comes up on `http://localhost:8080` and the web on `http://localhost:3080`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/shell/v1/health
# {"status":"healthy","service":"shell","checkedAt":"..."}
```

Node.js 24 or newer is required. Docker is only needed to deploy.

## Options

```
npx create-qpq-app <app-name> [options]

--language <typescript|javascript>   skip the language prompt
--domain <domain>                    app domain (default: <app-name>.example.com)
--no-git                             skip git init
--no-install                         skip npm install
```

Pass `--language javascript` and you get the same app with type annotations stripped and JSX preserved, running on the same toolchain.

## How it works

The template is a snapshot of quidproquojs.com, a real and continuously built qpq workspace, captured into this package at publish time. Scaffolding runs a pipeline of self-contained steps: prune the docs site, prune the website app, apply your app's identity and domain, pin the quidproquo versions, git init, install.

The generated app pins the `quidproquo-*` versions this package was published with. The whole family releases in lockstep, so those versions are always a set that was built and tested together.

## Status

Pre-1.0 and under active development. The generated app changes shape between releases.
