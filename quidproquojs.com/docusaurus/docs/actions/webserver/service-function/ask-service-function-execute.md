description: Invoke a service function (an RPC-style story) by name and receive its typed result.

# askServiceFunctionExecute

Invokes a [service function](../../../config/webserver/service-function.md) — a story deployed for direct, RPC-style invocation — by name, passing a typed payload and receiving the function's typed result. Use it to call another service's (or your own service's) business logic directly, without going through an HTTP route.

- **Action type:** `ServiceFunctionActionType.Execute`
- **On AWS:** invokes the target function's dedicated Lambda (`<functionName>-sfunc`) directly by name. When `isAsync` is `false` (the default) the call is synchronous and returns the function's result; when `true` it is a fire-and-forget async invocation that resolves without a result.

```typescript
import { askServiceFunctionExecute } from 'quidproquo-webserver';

interface ResizeRequest { drive: string; filepath: string; width: number; }
interface ResizeResult { thumbnailPath: string; }

export function* askMakeThumbnail(filepath: string) {
  const result = yield* askServiceFunctionExecute<ResizeResult, ResizeRequest>(
    'media',        // service name
    'resizeImage',  // function name
    { drive: 'uploads', filepath, width: 256 },
  );

  return result.thumbnailPath;
}
```

## Signature

```typescript
function* askServiceFunctionExecute<R, T>(
  service: string,
  functionName: string,
  payload: T,
  isAsync?: boolean,
): AskResponse<R>;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `service` | `string` | – | Name of the service that owns the target function. |
| `functionName` | `string` | – | Name of the [service function](../../../config/webserver/service-function.md) to invoke (its `functionName`, which defaults to the story name). |
| `payload` | `T` | – | The typed payload passed to the function's story. |
| `isAsync` | `boolean` | `false` | When `false`, wait for and return the result. When `true`, invoke fire-and-forget and resolve without a result. |

## Returns

`R` — the value returned by the invoked function's story. When `isAsync` is `true` there is no meaningful result (the async invocation resolves without waiting for the function to finish).
