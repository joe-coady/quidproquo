# askStateMachineSendEvent

Sends an event to a [state-machine](../../config/xstate/state-machine.md) instance, driving a transition. The runtime rehydrates the instance, evaluates its guards, applies the event, runs any side-effect actions, and persists the new state. This is how a durable workflow moves forward over time.

- **Action type:** `StateMachineActionType.SendEvent`
- **On the runtime:** the processor loads the instance from the backing key-value store, runs **every** configured guard story with `(entity, event)` to resolve each guard to a boolean, rehydrates the XState actor from the persisted snapshot, sends the event, and captures the new snapshot. If the event did not change state (and the machine is not done), it fails; otherwise it persists the new snapshot and runs the stories mapped to any actions that fired during the transition, passing `(entity, event)`.

```typescript
import { askStateMachineSendEvent } from 'quidproquo-xstate';

export function* payOrder(orderId: string, paymentRef: string) {
  const order = yield* askStateMachineSendEvent('order', orderId, {
    type: 'PAY',
    paymentRef,
  });

  return order; // the updated, re-persisted entity
}
```

## Signature

```typescript
function* askStateMachineSendEvent<T>(
  stateMachineName: string,
  id: string,
  event: StateMachineEvent,
): AskResponse<T>;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stateMachineName` | `string` | Name of the machine — must match a machine declared with [defineStateMachine](../../config/xstate/state-machine.md). |
| `id` | `string` | The id of the instance to advance. |
| `event` | `StateMachineEvent` | The event to send. Its `type` selects the transition; any extra fields are payload passed through to guard and action stories. |

### `StateMachineEvent`

```typescript
interface StateMachineEvent {
  type: string;       // the XState event name (e.g. 'PAY', 'CANCEL')
  [key: string]: any; // optional payload available to guards and actions
}
```

## Returns

`T` — the updated, re-persisted entity, with the new machine snapshot stored under the machine's `stateField`. Read the resulting state name with [askStateMachineGetState](./ask-state-machine-get-state.md).

## Notes

- **Guards run first, and all of them.** Before the event is applied, every guard story configured on the machine is executed with `(entity, event)` and reduced to a boolean, then fed to XState. Keep guard stories side-effect-light.
- **Actions run after the transition is persisted.** Each XState action that fires during the transition runs its mapped story with `(entity, event)`; a story error aborts the action with that error.
- **Invalid events fail.** If the event produces no state change and the machine is not in a final state, the action fails with `ErrorTypeEnum.BadRequest` (`Event '<type>' is not valid for current state '<state>'`).
- Fails with `ErrorTypeEnum.NotFound` if the machine name is unknown or the instance does not exist. Guard/action story errors and the persistence upsert error propagate with their own error types. Use [askCatch](../core/system/ask-catch.md) to handle these in-story.
