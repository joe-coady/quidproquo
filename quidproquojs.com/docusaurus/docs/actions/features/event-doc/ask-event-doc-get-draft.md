# askEventDocGetDraft

Resolves the current **draft** version pointer for a document by `id`, or `null` if there is no draft (or the document is missing). Together with the three actions below, this is the set of **version reads** over an event document's `versions` history.

- **Built from:** [askEventDocGetById](./ask-event-doc-get-by-id.md) plus an in-memory version selector. Requires the store context — call it inside `askEventDocProvideStore({ storeName, type }, ...)`, or from a built-in route where the context is already provided.

First, a quick recap of the model (full detail on the [read-by-id page](./ask-event-doc-get-by-id.md#the-event-document-model)): an event document is derived by folding its event log. Each **version** pointer in the summary's `versions` array records the `eventId` of its last event (its head) and, once published, its `publishedAt` and `effectiveFrom` times. The tail version with no `publishedAt` is the **draft**; a `PUBLISH` event freezes a version and opens the next draft.

```typescript
import { askEventDocGetDraft } from 'quidproquo-features';

export function* currentDraft(id: string) {
  const draft = yield* askEventDocGetDraft(id);
  return draft; // EventDocVersion | null
}
```

## Signature

```typescript
function* askEventDocGetDraft(id: string): AskResponse<Nullable<EventDocVersion>>;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | Id of the document. |

## Returns

`EventDocVersion | null` — the draft version pointer (the tail version with no `publishedAt`), or `null` when the document has no draft or does not exist.

### `EventDocVersion`

```typescript
type EventDocVersion = {
  version: number;
  eventId: string;       // sortable id of this version's head event
  publishedAt?: string;  // unset while it is the tail draft
  effectiveFrom?: string; // when the publish takes effect (as-of selection)
};
```

To fold or render a version's content, fold the log's events whose `eventId` sorts at or before the version's `eventId`.

---

## askEventDocGetLatestPublished

Resolves the **latest published** version pointer for a document (the highest version that has a `publishedAt`), or `null` if nothing is published yet or the document is missing.

```typescript
function* askEventDocGetLatestPublished(id: string): AskResponse<Nullable<EventDocVersion>>;
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | Id of the document. |

**Returns** `EventDocVersion | null` — the highest version with a `publishedAt`, or `null`.

## askEventDocGetPublishedAsOf

Resolves the version **published at or before** a given clock time — as-of-clock time-travel keyed on `publishedAt`. Pass a version's own `publishedAt` to render it as-was, or `now` for the latest. Returns `null` when nothing was published by that time (or the document is missing).

```typescript
function* askEventDocGetPublishedAsOf(
  id: string,
  clock: QpqIsoDateTime,
): AskResponse<Nullable<EventDocVersion>>;
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | Id of the document. |
| `clock` | `QpqIsoDateTime` | ISO-8601 timestamp to resolve as-of. |

**Returns** `EventDocVersion | null` — the highest version with `publishedAt <= clock`, or `null`.

## askEventDocPublishedVersionAsOf

Returns the version published and *effective* at `clock`, together with the document **state** at that version's head — folded snapshot-seeded (via `askEventDocDocumentStateAsOf`), so cost tracks the gap since the nearest snapshot rather than the whole log. It resolves the version from the summary via `effectiveFrom` (when the publish takes effect, so a publish scheduled for the future stays invisible until then), then folds the state as of `version.eventId`. Use `state` directly to render the published, as-of-`clock` content, and `version.publishedAt` to pin the doc's own linked assets to the moment it was published — the generic backbone of a "render published" flow. (This mirrors `askEventDocGetPublishedAsOf`, which returns only the version pointer, and keys on `publishedAt` rather than `effectiveFrom`.)

```typescript
function* askEventDocPublishedVersionAsOf(
  id: string,
  clock: QpqIsoDateTime,
): AskResponse<Nullable<EventDocVersionState>>;
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `string` | Id of the document. |
| `clock` | `QpqIsoDateTime` | ISO-8601 timestamp to resolve the effective version as-of. |

**Returns** `EventDocVersionState | null` — `{ version, state }` for the effective version, or `null` when the document is missing/deleted, nothing is effective yet, or the version's events are gone (a rewritten log).
