# askDateNow

Reads the current wall-clock time from the runtime and returns it as an ISO-8601 timestamp string.

- **Action type:** `DateActionType.Now`
- **At runtime:** resolves to `new Date()` formatted as a UTC ISO-8601 string (e.g. `2026-06-26T00:00:00.000Z`).

Reading the clock is a source of non-determinism, so a story never calls `new Date()` directly. Instead it `yield*`s this action and lets the runtime supply the value. Because the runtime resolves the action, the resolved timestamp is recorded in the execution log — the story stays a pure generator that can be inspected, tested, and replayed with the exact same "now" it saw on the original run.

```typescript
import { askDateNow } from 'quidproquo-core';

export function* askStampRecord() {
  const createdAt = yield* askDateNow();
  return { createdAt };
}
```

## Signature

```typescript
function* askDateNow(): AskResponse<QpqIsoDateTime>;
```

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

`QpqIsoDateTime` — the current time as a UTC ISO-8601 string of the form `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ` (e.g. `2026-06-26T00:00:00.000Z`). `QpqIsoDateTime` is a template-literal string type exported from quidproquo-core, so it is a plain `string` at runtime with extra compile-time shape checking.

## Notes

- The timestamp is always in UTC (trailing `Z`) with millisecond precision.
- Being a string, the value is safe to store in a key-value store, return from an API, or compare lexicographically (ISO-8601 sorts chronologically as text).
