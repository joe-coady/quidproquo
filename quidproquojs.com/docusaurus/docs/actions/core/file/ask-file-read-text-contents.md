# askFileReadTextContents

Reads the contents of a file on a [storage drive](../../../config/core/storage-drive.md) and returns it as a string.

- **Action type:** `FileActionType.ReadTextContents`

```typescript
import { askFileReadTextContents } from 'quidproquo-core';

export function* askGetWelcomeMessage() {
  const message = yield* askFileReadTextContents('templates', 'emails/welcome.txt');
  return message;
}
```

## Signature

```typescript
function* askFileReadTextContents(
  drive: string,
  filepath: string,
  scope?: string,
): AskResponse<string>;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `drive` | `string` | Name of the storage drive to read from — must match a drive declared with [defineStorageDrive](../../../config/core/storage-drive.md) (or one shared via its `owner` option). |
| `filepath` | `string` | Path of the file within the drive. Always use forward slashes, e.g. `'reports/2026/summary.txt'`. |
| `scope` | `string` | Optional storage-scope segment. When set, the processor reads `{scope}/{filepath}` instead, partitioning the drive (used by tenant/scoped features such as the event-doc `scopeResolver`). Must be a single path segment: no separators, `..`, or null bytes. |

## Returns

`string` — the full file contents, decoded as text.

## Errors

| Error | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `FileReadTextContentsErrorTypeEnum.InvalidStorageClass` | The file is in a cold storage tier and cannot be read directly. Check first with `askFileIsColdStorage`. |
| `FileReadTextContentsErrorTypeEnum.FileNotFound` | No file exists at the given `filepath` on the drive. |
| `FileReadTextContentsErrorTypeEnum.InvalidScope` | The `scope` is not a valid single path segment (empty, too long, or contains separators, `..`, or null bytes), or the scoped `filepath` is absolute or contains `..` segments or null bytes. |

Errors thrown by actions can be caught with `askCatch` from quidproquo-core. It returns an `EitherActionResult` — `{ success: true, result }` on success, or `{ success: false, error }` on failure:

```typescript
const outcome = yield* askCatch(askFileReadTextContents('templates', 'emails/welcome.txt'));

if (outcome.success) {
  const contents = outcome.result;
  // ...
} else {
  // outcome.error.errorType / outcome.error.errorText
}
```
