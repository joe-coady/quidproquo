description: Delete one or more files from a storage drive.

# askFileDelete

Deletes one or more files from a [storage drive](../../../config/core/storage-drive.md). Deleting a file that does not exist is treated as a success, so this action is safe to call idempotently.

- **Action type:** `FileActionType.Delete`
- **On AWS:** issues a single S3 `DeleteObjects` batch request against the drive's bucket for all of the given paths.

```typescript
import { askFileDelete } from 'quidproquo-core';

export function* askRemoveOldExports() {
  yield* askFileDelete('reports', ['exports/january.csv', 'exports/february.csv']);
}
```

## Signature

```typescript
function* askFileDelete(
  drive: string,
  filepaths: string[],
): AskResponse<string[]>;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `drive` | `string` | Name of the storage drive to delete from — must match a drive declared with [defineStorageDrive](../../../config/core/storage-drive.md) (or one shared via its `owner` option). |
| `filepaths` | `string[]` | The paths of the files to delete within the drive, forward-slash delimited. Pass one path or many in a single call. |

## Returns

`string[]` — the paths that **failed** to delete. An empty array means every file was deleted (or did not exist to begin with). A non-empty array is a partial failure you may choose to retry.

## Errors

| Error | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `FileDeleteErrorTypeEnum.AccessDenied` | The caller lacks permission to delete from this drive (e.g. a foreign drive shared without write access). |
| `FileDeleteErrorTypeEnum.DriveNotFound` | No storage drive with that name exists in the deployed config. |

Errors thrown by actions can be caught with `askCatch` from quidproquo-core. It returns an `EitherActionResult` — `{ success: true, result }` on success, or `{ success: false, error }` on failure:

```typescript
const outcome = yield* askCatch(askFileDelete('reports', ['exports/old.csv']));

if (outcome.success) {
  const failedPaths = outcome.result; // empty if all deleted
} else {
  // outcome.error.errorType / outcome.error.errorText
}
```

## Notes

- If the drive declares an `onEvent.delete` handler in [defineStorageDrive](../../../config/core/storage-drive.md#file-events-onevent), that story is triggered for the deleted files.
