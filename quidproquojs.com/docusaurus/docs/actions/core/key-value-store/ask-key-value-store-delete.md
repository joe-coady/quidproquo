description: Delete a single record from a key-value store by its key.

# askKeyValueStoreDelete

Removes one record from a [key-value store](../../../config/core/key-value-store.md), addressed by its key. Deleting a record that doesn't exist is a no-op.

- **Action type:** `KeyValueStoreActionType.Delete`

```typescript
import { askKeyValueStoreDelete } from 'quidproquo-core';

export function* askRemoveUser(userId: string) {
  yield* askKeyValueStoreDelete('users', userId);
}
```

## Signature

```typescript
function* askKeyValueStoreDelete(
  keyValueStoreName: string,
  key: KvsCoreDataType,
  sortKey?: KvsCoreDataType,
  options?: KeyValueStoreDeleteOptions,
): AskResponse<void>;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `keyValueStoreName` | `string` | Name of the store — must match a store declared with [defineKeyValueStore](../../../config/core/key-value-store.md) (or one shared via its `owner` option). |
| `key` | `KvsCoreDataType` | Partition key value of the record to delete (`string \| number`). |
| `sortKey` | `KvsCoreDataType` | Sort key value, required only if the store declares a sort key (`string \| number`). |
| `options` | `KeyValueStoreDeleteOptions` | Optional delete options (see below). |

### `KeyValueStoreDeleteOptions`

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scope` | `string` | – | Optional storage scope. The processor composes it into the partition key value, so the delete only addresses the record written under that scope (used by tenant/scoped features). Requires the store's partition key to be string-typed. |

## Returns

`void` — the story resumes once the delete has committed.

## Errors

| Error | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `KeyValueStoreDeleteErrorTypeEnum.ServiceUnavailable` | DynamoDB internal error or throttling. |
| `KeyValueStoreDeleteErrorTypeEnum.ResourceNotFound` | The underlying table does not exist. |
| `KeyValueStoreDeleteErrorTypeEnum.InvalidScope` | The `scope` option is malformed (empty, `.`, over 128 characters, or containing path separators, `..`, `@`, or null bytes), the store's partition key is not string-typed, or the partition-key value contains the reserved `@@QPQSCOPE@@` delimiter (reserved on string-pk stores, so unscoped calls reject it too). |
| `KeyValueStoreDeleteErrorTypeEnum.StoreNotFound` | The key value store is not declared in the qpq config (misconfiguration, e.g. a wrong name or a missing `defineKeyValueStore`). |

Catch errors with `askCatch` — it returns `{ success: true, result }` or `{ success: false, error }`.
