description: Add an AI chat experience to an eventDoc collection — per-document chats, streamed replies, tools, and the websocket handlers that serve them.

# defineEventDocAi

Declares an **AI chat feature** attached to an [eventDoc](./event-doc.md) collection. It is the AI sibling of `defineEventDoc`: every chat is scoped to a single document in the collection, its messages are persisted, and the assistant's reply streams back to the browser token by token over a websocket.

`defineEventDocAi` returns an array of QPQ config settings, so spread it into your service config alongside the collection's own `defineEventDoc*` settings. In one call it:

- provisions a **storage drive** for chat histories (one JSON file per chat) and a **key-value store** listing each document's chats,
- registers an **AI** (model + tools) the chat turns prompt through, and
- subscribes a dedicated **queue** of four websocket service-request handlers (`onChatCreate`, `onChatList`, `onChatHistory`, `onChatSend`) that ship inside quidproquo-features.

The handlers and any tool executors read the wiring from per-processor globals, exactly like `defineEventDocRoutes`' controllers — you do not write the backend, only configure it.

- **On AWS:** deploys the union of the four config settings it returns — a DynamoDB table ([defineKeyValueStore](../core/key-value-store.md), partition `docId` / sort `chatId`) for the chat list, an S3 bucket ([defineStorageDrive](../core/storage-drive.md)) for chat-history JSON, the AI registration ([defineAi](../core/ai.md), granting Bedrock model access and registering the `tools`), and an SQS queue ([defineQueue](../core/queue.md)) subscribed to `eventBusName` whose processors are the four chat websocket handlers. Names are derived from `storeName`, so the same config deploys per environment without collisions.

```typescript
import { defineEventDocAi } from 'quidproquo-features';
import { AiModel } from 'quidproquo-core';

export default [
  // ...the collection's own defineEventDoc* settings

  ...defineEventDocAi({
    storeName: 'project',
    type: 'project',
    serviceName: 'app',
    eventBusName: 'app-ws-events',
    userDirectoryName: 'users',
    // optional: model, system prompt, tools, reasoning budget
  }),
];
```

## Signature

```typescript
function defineEventDocAi(options: EventDocAiOptions): QPQConfig;
```

`QPQConfig` here is the array of config settings described above.

## Parameters

All options are a single `EventDocAiOptions` object.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `storeName` | `string` | – (required) | The eventDoc collection these chats attach to. Must match the collection's `defineEventDoc` store name — the same document store the chats are scoped against. Also the seed for the chat drive, chat-list store, and queue names. |
| `type` | `string` | – (required) | The collection's document type. Combined with each method verb by `buildEventDocAiMethodName` (`eventDocAi/<type>/<method>`) so multiple collections' chats coexist on one service. |
| `serviceName` | `string` | – (required) | The service the websocket requests route through. Must match the `serviceName` the frontend provides to the chat context (see [askEventDocAiContextProvide](../../actions/features/event-doc-ai/ask-event-doc-ai-context-read.md)). |
| `eventBusName` | `string` | – (required) | The websocket events bus the chat queue subscribes to (application-specific). |
| `userDirectoryName` | `string` | – (required) | The user directory used to resolve the acting user (chats record `createdByUserId`; the send handler gates on connection auth). |
| `aiName` | `string` | `` `${storeName}-ai` `` | Name of the AI registration ([defineAi](../core/ai.md)) the turns prompt through. Override to share or namespace the AI. |
| `model` | `AiModel` | `AiModel.ClaudeSonnet46` | The model each chat turn is sent to. |
| `systemPrompt` | `string` | – | A static system prompt for every turn. Used when no `systemPromptGenerator` is set (or the generator returns empty). Falls back to a built-in default (`"You are a helpful assistant. Use tools when appropriate."`) if neither is provided. |
| `systemPromptGenerator` | `string` | – | Name of a `defineInlineFunction` invoked on **every** turn to build the system prompt. It receives an `EventDocAiSystemPromptInput` (`{ docId }`, the trusted document id) and returns a string — so the prompt can carry live document state. A non-empty result overrides `systemPrompt`; an empty result falls back to it. |
| `tools` | `AiToolDefinition[]` | `[]` | Tools the model may call, registered on the AI. Executors are `defineInlineFunction` names supplied by the caller. Tool runtimes inherit the chat's session context, so they read the trusted `docId` from context rather than trusting the model to pass it. |
| `reasoningBudgetTokens` | `number` | `4096` | Extended-thinking token budget. Pass `0` to disable reasoning entirely. Reasoning streams to the chat as `reasoning` segments so the user sees progress instead of a silent wait. |

## The chat model

- A **chat** is scoped to one document (`docId`) in the collection. Its summary — `{ docId, chatId, name, createdAt, updatedAt, createdByUserId }` (`EventDocAiChatSummary`) — is a row in the chat-list key-value store (partition `docId`, sort `chatId`).
- A chat's **message history** is stored as a single JSON file on the chat drive at `` `${docId}/${chatId}/history.json` ``, holding an array of `EventDocAiChatMessage` (`{ role, segments[] }`). Segments are the durable content format: `text`, `reasoning`, `file` (an attachment), and `tool-use` (tool calls paired with results).
- **Sending a message** appends the user message to the history, streams the assistant's reply through [askAiPromptStream](../../actions/core/ai/ask-ai-prompt-stream.md), dispatches each stream part to the UI live, then folds the completed reply into durable segments, appends it, and bumps the chat's `updatedAt`. Stream parts are transport-only — they never persist; only the folded segments are saved.
- **Attachments** are eventDoc assets (uploaded via the collection's asset routes) referenced by bare `assetId`. The send flow validates each id against the session's trusted `docId` before it can reach the model, so a client can never point the AI at another document's files.

The four verbs — chat create, list, history, and send — are exposed to the browser as websocket service requests. See the [Event Doc AI actions](../../actions/features/event-doc-ai/ask-event-doc-ai-process-send.md) for the requesters, and the `askUIEventDocAi*` UI actions for driving the chat SPA's state.

## Examples

```typescript
import { defineEventDocAi } from 'quidproquo-features';
import { AiModel } from 'quidproquo-core';

export default [
  // A per-document assistant with tools and a document-aware system prompt.
  ...defineEventDocAi({
    storeName: 'project',
    type: 'project',
    serviceName: 'app',
    eventBusName: 'app-ws-events',
    userDirectoryName: 'users',
    model: AiModel.ClaudeSonnet46,
    systemPromptGenerator: '/entry/ai/buildProjectPrompt::buildProjectPrompt',
    tools: [
      /* AiToolDefinition[]; executors registered via defineInlineFunction */
    ],
    reasoningBudgetTokens: 8192,
  }),
];
```
