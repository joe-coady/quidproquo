# defineAwsServiceAccountInfo

Binds this service to the **AWS account and region** it deploys into, and carries service-wide Lambda and logging defaults. It is the one required AWS setting — the deploy reads the target account/region from here, and cross-module resolution uses the `serviceInfoMap` to locate sibling services in other accounts/regions/environments. Exactly one `defineAwsServiceAccountInfo` is allowed per config.

- **On AWS:** consumed throughout `quidproquo-deploy-awscdk` and `quidproquo-actionprocessor-awslambda` via `getAwsServiceAccountInfoConfig` and friends. `deployAccountId`/`deployRegion` set the CloudFormation stack env; `apiLayers` become Lambda layer references; `lambdaMaxMemoryInMiB` sets the default function memory; the `disable*` flags toggle X-Ray tracing, reserved concurrency, and the Lambda-warming schedule; `logServiceName`, `disableLogs`, and `instantLogs` drive the logging pipeline. Resources across the `serviceInfoMap` are matched by module/environment/feature/application to resolve cross-service references.

```typescript
import { defineAwsServiceAccountInfo } from 'quidproquo-config-aws';

export default [
  defineAwsServiceAccountInfo('123456789012', 'us-east-1'),
];
```

## Signature

```typescript
function defineAwsServiceAccountInfo(
  deployAccountId: string,
  deployRegion: string,
  serviceInfoMap?: ServiceAccountInfo[],
  options?: QPQConfigAdvancedAwsServiceAccountInfoSettings,
): AwsServiceAccountInfoQPQConfigSetting;
```

## Parameters

### `deployAccountId` — `string` (required)

The AWS account id this service deploys into. Sets the CloudFormation stack account and is the default account for the service's own resources.

### `deployRegion` — `string` (required)

The AWS region this service deploys into.

### `serviceInfoMap` — `ServiceAccountInfo[]` (optional, default `[]`)

The account/region (and environment/feature) coordinates of **other** services this one references, so cross-module resource lookups can resolve resources that live in different accounts, regions, environments, or features. The current service's own entry is added automatically. Each entry:

```typescript
type ServiceAccountInfo = {
  moduleName: string;
  applicationName?: string;
  environment?: string;
  feature?: string;
  awsAccountId: string;
  awsRegion: string;
};
```

- **`moduleName`** — the module (service) name being located.
- **`applicationName` / `environment` / `feature`** — optional narrowing; unset parts match the current service. Cross-service resolution scores candidates by how specifically they match.
- **`awsAccountId` / `awsRegion`** — where that module is deployed.

### `options` — `QPQConfigAdvancedAwsServiceAccountInfoSettings` (optional)

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `apiLayers` | `ApiLayer[]` | `[]` | Lambda layers to attach to the service's functions. See [ApiLayer](#apilayer). |
| `lambdaMaxMemoryInMiB` | `number` | `1024` | Default memory (MiB) for the service's Lambda functions. Individual functions may still override this. |
| `logServiceName` | `string` | – | The service name used when writing structured logs. |
| `disableLogs` | `boolean` | `false` | Turn off the log-shipping pipeline for the service. |
| `disableLambdaWarming` | `boolean` | `false` | Don't create the scheduled warming rule that keeps functions warm. |
| `disableReservedConcurrency` | `boolean` | `false` | Don't apply reserved concurrency to functions (leaves them on unreserved account concurrency). |
| `disableTracing` | `boolean` | `false` | Deploy functions with X-Ray tracing set to `DISABLED` instead of `ACTIVE`. |
| `instantLogs` | `boolean` | `false` | Flush logs immediately rather than batching them (higher cost/visibility trade-off). |

### `ApiLayer`

```typescript
interface ApiLayer {
  buildPath?: string;
  name: string;
  layerArn?: string;
}
```

- **`name`** — identifier for the layer.
- **`buildPath`** — optional local path to build the layer from.
- **`layerArn`** — optional ARN of an existing published layer to reference.

## Examples

```typescript
import { defineAwsServiceAccountInfo } from 'quidproquo-config-aws';

export default [
  // Minimal: just the deploy target
  defineAwsServiceAccountInfo('123456789012', 'us-east-1'),

  // With a sibling service in another account and some tuning
  defineAwsServiceAccountInfo(
    '123456789012',
    'us-east-1',
    [
      { moduleName: 'billing-service', awsAccountId: '210987654321', awsRegion: 'us-east-1' },
    ],
    {
      lambdaMaxMemoryInMiB: 2048,
      disableLambdaWarming: true,
    },
  ),
];
```
