/**
 * Project a document as of ONE event: fold every view of the log up to (and including)
 * that event ONCE, then persist the summary row from the fold's `summary` view and the
 * per-view snapshot set. One incremental fold drives both projections — the summary is
 * no longer a separate whole-log re-derivation per stream delivery.
 *
 * INCREMENTAL by default: the newest complete snapshot at or before the event seeds the
 * fold, and only the gap since it is read and folded — so the work per stream delivery
 * tracks the size of the burst, not the length of the log. The equivalence to a
 * from-scratch fold is owned by the fold layer (state-based acceptance + era-pinned
 * seeds, see foldSnapshotViews); this function only finds the seed and the gap. With no
 * usable seed — no snapshot yet, a pre-manifest snapshot, a partial set, or a fold that
 * declines the seed (a view added since it was written) — it falls back to folding the
 * whole prefix, whose write then restores a complete seed for next time.
 *
 * Anything the fold CANNOT produce (a broken registration, a log emptied out from under
 * the stream) degrades to askEventDocSummaryRederive so the summary row is still
 * maintained exactly as it always was — snapshots are the optimisation, the summary is
 * the contract.
 *
 * Write order is summary FIRST, then snapshots. A crash between the two leaves the seed
 * older than the event, so the replayed delivery refolds and rewrites both. The inverse
 * order would let a replay find the snapshot set complete and skip the summary forever —
 * which is also why a seed already AT the event still rewrites the summary row from the
 * seed's own summary view (cheap, idempotent) instead of returning outright.
 *
 * Event reads are CONSISTENT: the caller is the event store's stream handler, so the
 * event being projected was durably written moments ago, and an eventually-consistent
 * query can still miss it — which would store a snapshot at eventId that silently lacks
 * the event it claims to capture, permanently (nothing later rewrites an old eventId).
 * The seed read stays eventually consistent — a stale seed only means folding a longer
 * gap for the same answer.
