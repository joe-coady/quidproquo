// The per-document work one stream delivery triggers: ONE incremental fold that writes

// newest event — so per-delivery cost tracks the burst, not the log. Pure derivations
// of the log, which is what makes the stream's at-least-once delivery and its retries
// harmless — re-running rewrites the same facts.
//
// The whole-log rederive remains for the cases the incremental fold can't serve: a
// collection with no registered functions object (nothing to fold views with), and a
// Remove record — rows were deleted out from under the stream (a transfer rewrote the
// log), so a snapshot-seeded fold could resume from a snapshot of the OLD log; there is
// also no new event to snapshot at.
//
// Snapshots fragment along the stream's own batching: coalescing hands this handler the
// LAST event per document per batch, so a lone append projects at that event while a
// burst of a hundred projects once, at the burst's newest.

 * Rebuild a document's summary from its log — and store its snapshot — driven by the

 *
 * This is what lets the summary be a pure projection. The writer appends an event and stops;
 * nothing on the write path maintains a read model, so the record can be dropped and rebuilt
 * at any time, and a document can have as many views as you care to project.
 *
 * Invoked once per changed document per batch (the store declares
 * `coalesceByPartitionKey`), so a burst of appends to one document costs ONE rebuild rather
 * than one per event. Re-deriving from the log is idempotent, which is what makes a stream's
 * at-least-once delivery and its retries harmless.
