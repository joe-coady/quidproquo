// (doc, view) makes "the latest snapshot at or before this event, for this view" a plain
// descending sort-key range — the exact read the incremental fold wants — while the sort
// key stays the SAME sortable event id the history table is ordered by, so a snapshot row
// and the event it captures always correlate by key alone.
//
// `type` is the COLLECTION type, denormalised for the same reason it is on every event
// row: one store can host several collections, and a reader holding only the row must
// know which one this snapshot belongs to.
