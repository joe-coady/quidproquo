/**
 * Load the newest DOCUMENT-view snapshot at or before `upToEventId` as a reader's fold
 * base, or null when there is nothing usable and the reader should fold from scratch.
 *
 * The sibling of askEventDocSnapshotSeedLatest with the reader's (not the projector's)
 * requirements: a reader folds only the document view, so the sibling views and the
 * manifest check are irrelevant here — the document row's own state is complete the
 * moment the row exists, whether or not the rest of its set landed.
 *
 * `upToEventId` should be the log's current head: snapshot rows are not deleted with
 * their events (a transfer overwrite rewrites the log but leaves the SS store), so an
 * unclamped read could serve a snapshot newer than every event that now exists. Clamping
 * to the head bounds that failure to snapshots that collide with the new log's id range —
 * removing it entirely is the SS-cleanup follow-up, not this read's job.
 *
 * Reads are eventually consistent on purpose: the base is an optimisation, not a
 * correctness input — a stale replica surfaces an older base and the reader folds a
 * longer tail for the same answer.
