// Store ONE view's folded state at one event: inline on the snapshot row when it is
// small, offloaded to the collection's blob drive when it is not (a folded state has no
// size bound; a KVS row does). The blob lands FIRST so an offloaded row never points at
// bytes that are not there yet, and its path is derived from the row's own keys, so
// nothing is stored twice. Writes are unconditional upserts: snapshots are pure
// derivations of the log, so a replay (the stream's at-least-once delivery) rewrites the
// identical fact, and last-write-wins is exactly right.
//
// `views` is the manifest stamped on the document row (see EventDocSnapshot) — callers
// write a whole per-view set via askEventDocSnapshotViewsWrite, which owns the ordering
// that makes the manifest-carrying row the set's commit marker.
