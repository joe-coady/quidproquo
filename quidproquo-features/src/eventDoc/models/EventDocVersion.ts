 * appended event while it is the tail draft (a published version freezes on its PUBLISH
 * event). To fold/render a version's content, fold events with index <= `eventIndex`.
 * `publishedAt` is when the version was published; `effectiveFrom` is when that publish
 * takes effect (for as-of selection) — both unset while it is the tail draft.
