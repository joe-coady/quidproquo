// Circular import detection for every QPQ rspack build (dev server, lambda
// bundles, service remotes, views).
//
// A module cycle is only conditionally safe: it works or breaks depending on
// which file happens to be the entry point into the cycle (ESM throws a TDZ
// ReferenceError, CJS silently gives a partial exports object). We treat every
// cycle as a defect. Third-party packages are excluded — workspace and linked
// packages resolve through symlinks to their real paths outside node_modules,
// so first-party code is always checked.
//
// Cycles are reported through onDetected with a direct console print because
// several build paths suppress warnings (views dev runs stats:'errors-only');
// they are also pushed as compilation ERRORS so the build fails. Cycles are
// never acceptable — QPQ_CIRCULAR_DEPS_WARN=1 is a temporary escape hatch that
// downgrades them to warnings while fixing.
