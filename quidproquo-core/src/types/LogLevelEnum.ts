  // in which one of the crucial business functionality is no longer working. A FATAL log

  // like a database or all the payment systems are not available and users can’t checkout
  // their baskets in your e-commerce.
  Fatal = 0,

  // the log level that should be used when the application hits an issue preventing one or
  // more functionalities from properly functioning. The ERROR log level can be used when
  // one of the payment systems is not available, but there is still the option to check
  // out the basket in the e-commerce application or when your social media logging option
  // is not working for some reason.

  // problem, or a situation that might disturb one of the processes. But that doesn’t
  // mean that the application failed. The WARN level should be used in situations that
  // are unexpected, but the code can continue the work. For example, a parsing error
  // occurred that resulted in a certain document not being processed.

  // The standard log level indicating that something happened, the application entered a
  // certain state, etc. For example, a controller of your authorization API may include an
  // INFO log level with information on which user requested authorization if the

  // should be purely informative and not looking into them on a regular basis shouldn’t
  // result in missing any important information.

  // for diagnosing issues and troubleshooting or when running application in the test
  // environment for the purpose of making sure everything is running correctly
  Debug = 4,

  // the most fine-grained information only used in rare cases where you need the
  // full visibility of what is happening in your application and inside the third-party
  // libraries that you use. You can expect the TRACE logging level to be very verbose.
  // You can use it for example to annotate each step in the algorithm or each individual
  // query with parameters in your code.
