# Changelog

## 0.1.13

- web-react: the runtime store is rewritten from jotai to an internal refcounted qpq store. Definitions take a single options object with a
  `uniqueName` (federated modules that bind the same name share state) and an optional `onInit` story, and area state is cleaned up when its last
  consumer unmounts. Apps wrap their tree in a `QpqStoreProvider`
- kvs change data capture: `defineKeyValueStore` accepts an `onStream` handler that receives insert/modify/remove records with old and new values,
  backed by DynamoDB streams on AWS and fully supported in the dev server, with batch size, batching window, and per-partition-key coalescing options
- event docs: event ids move from a numeric counter to sortable uuidv7 strings (admin session logs use the same ids), soft delete and restore are
  recorded as reserved DELETE/RESTORE events with a new `askEventDocRestore` to undo a delete, and the summary row is rebuilt asynchronously by a kvs
  stream projector instead of on the append path
- new `askKeyValueStoreScanAllScopes` action: scan a store across every tenant/personal scope, for writing migrations
- cli: new `qpq migrate` command runs pending migrations against the local dev server
- web-react: a websocket service-request correlation stays alive after the response arrives, so a handler that responds first and keeps streaming no
  longer has its later messages dropped
- deploy-rspack: `react-refresh` is now a declared dependency instead of being assumed from the consumer

### Breaking changes

- `EventDocStoredEvent` gains a required `type` field; `eventDocEventToStoredEvent` takes a new `type` argument
- event-doc summaries rebuild asynchronously after append; re-read after a delay or fold the log if you need the just-appended event
- event-doc event ids are strings now: `EventDocEventMetadata.index`, `EventDocVersion.eventIndex`, and `EventDocLink`'s `eventIndex` become
  `eventId: string`, and `EventDocStoredEvent.sk` becomes a string
- `EventDocEventListOptions.afterIndex` is renamed to `afterEventId` (the `?afterIndex=` query param too)
- `askEventDocSoftDelete` requires a new `schemaVersion` argument; delete is now an event and `askEventDocRestore` undoes it
- `renumberWorkspaceEvents` is removed; committed workspace events mint a real id at commit time
- web-react runtimes must be bound inside a `QpqStoreProvider`; the jotai dependency is gone
- `createQpqRuntimeDefinition` takes a single options object with a required `uniqueName`
- `useQpqRuntime` drops the `mainStory` argument; move that story to the definition's `onInit`
- `createQpqRuntimeComputed` returns a `{ definition, compute }` object instead of a callable
- runtime state is deleted when its last consumer unmounts instead of persisting for the page's lifetime
- web-react's `hooks/asmj/*` deep imports are removed; import from the package root

## 0.1.12

- generic crypto: new `askCryptoEncrypt`/`askCryptoDecrypt` actions in core with `defineCryptoKey` config, KMS envelope encryption on AWS and a
  local master-key provider for node/dev-server
- event doc transfer: export a doc (events, assets, references) as a bundle and import it into another collection, with `defineEventDocTransfer`
  config, export/import on list screens gated by `canTransfer`, and imported events attributed to the importing user
- deploy-rspack: static assets in `src/public` are copied into the views build output
- aws lambda processor fixes: missing storage drives and undecodable auth tokens now raise typed errors, dynamo orm query/update expression fixes,
  jwt/s3/cognito filter fixes
- `askQueryParamsSet` in the browser keeps the url hash and no longer leaves a dangling `?` when the last param is removed
- log create no longer drops falsy log data, and network request logs no longer include urls
- neo4j: result type guards no longer throw on null cells
- quidproquo-testing: fix `toYieldSequence` dropping the given input
- cli: combined `go:dev` no longer interleaves "started" noise lines with the api output

### Breaking changes

- `GraphDatabaseNeo4jQPQConfigSetting` is removed from quidproquo-neo4j (it was never used)
- `EventDocListConfig` requires a new `canTransfer: boolean` field
- `EventDocListItem` requires a new `type: string` field
- `EventDocBundleApplyOptions` requires a new `importerUserId: string` field
- `askEventDocWriteForeignEvents` now takes an options object (`{ importerUserId, logRewritten? }`) instead of a trailing boolean
- `ApiRequestActionProcessorOptions.getHeaders` now returns `Nullable<Record<string, string>>`; return `null` instead of `undefined`
- `getStateMachineByName` now returns `Nullable`; check for `null` instead of `undefined`
- `askStateMachineSendEvent` now fails with `BadRequest` on a finished machine, and valid self transitions are accepted
- `StateMachineEvent` extra fields narrow from `any` to `unknown`
- `storyLogger`, `storyLoggerFs`, `getS3Logger`, `getS3LoggerViaExtension`, and `moveLogsToPerminateStorage` are removed; use `getLogger`
- `viewerRequestEventHandler` is removed; call `getCloudFrontRequestEvent_viewerRequest()` instead
- `QpqWarmLambdaEvent` is removed; warm invokes arrive as SNS warmer records
- `findMatchingCertificates` and `getDomainValidationOptions` (acm deep imports) are removed
- `getDefaultAppName` in quidproquo-deploy-rspack now returns `Nullable`; check for `null` instead of `undefined`
- `getGuidProcessor` is renamed to `getGuidActionProcessor`

## 0.1.11

- email sending: new `askEmailSendEmail` action in quidproquo-webserver, backed by SES v2 on AWS, with `defineEmailSender` config and an AWS sender
  allow list, plus `askEmailSetDeliveryStatus` for tracking delivery status
- admin action search: searchable action and entity indexes built from service logs, with definition registries for email and network actions, new
  admin routes, and an action search screen (filters, grid, entity timelines) in web-admin
- admin maintenance mode rebuilt as an event doc collection with typed update logs, active windows broadcast to the app websocket as public state,
  and stale websocket connections cleaned up during broadcasts
- event doc definitions: `createEventDocDefinition` describes a saved or local doc in one place, with new `askEventDocReadState` and
  `askEventDocReadIdentity` actions and generic set-code/set-name/draft/publish verbs merged in automatically
- `forceReloadFederatedRemote` in quidproquo-web for hot-swapping a federated remote without a full page reload
- event doc workspace snapshot restore now carries local slots and history through
- cli: views s3 sync sets cache-control headers (long-lived hashed assets, no-cache html)
- bump aws sdk clients, aws-cdk-lib, constructs, and lambda types; drop the adm-zip dependency

### Breaking changes

- `askSetMaintenanceMode` and the admin `POST /maintenance/set` route are removed; maintenance is now an event-doc collection at `/maintenance`
- the websocket maintenance broadcast now carries the full list of public maintenance states; the old `{ active, level, message }` types are removed
- `createEventDocWorkspace` output reshaped: per-slot verbs live at `docs.<slotKey>.api`, built-in verbs directly on `api`
- `EventDocWorkspaceDefinition.selectors` is removed; the workspace always builds its own selectors
- `createEventDocWorkspaceSlot` is removed; use `createEventDocDefinition` (with `saved: false` for local slots)

## 0.1.10

- event-doc workspace frontend state module: fold history at write time, transient (never-saved) event streams, typed per-slot errors, typed effects
  with asset transport, plus a new event-doc list state module
- logout and refresh-token work: revoke refresh token and global sign-out actions, configurable token refresh buffer, and preserve the existing
  refresh token when cognito doesn't rotate it
- circular import detection in the cli (`qpq check:circular`) and rspack builds, failing the build by default
- contentDisposition support for upload secure urls
- eslint-config: new yield-star and ask-prefix lint rules, and the qpq plugin is now exported for standalone use
- fix nested implementation stories dropping the caller's globals/context, and ai attachment scope resolution
- cli hardening: validate synth service names, shell-less spawn, and correctly quoted docker args
- new logo mark and a title shine effect on the nav

### Breaking changes

- `askApiRequest` and the `Api` action move from `quidproquo-web` to `quidproquo-webserver` (action type string changed too)
- reserved event-doc effects renamed to `EventDoc*` and now carry plain event data instead of pre-wrapped payloads
- `askUIEventDocWorkspaceApplyEvent` drops its `isPending` arg; every commit now lands in the slot's `pending` buffer
- `EventDocWorkspaceState` gains required `historyViews` and `transient` fields; the initial/reducer builders take slot configs
- `selectEventDocWorkspaceIsDirty`/`IsSaving` and `foldSlotHistory` removed; use a workspace's own selectors
- event-doc workspace slot errors are now typed (`EventDocWorkspaceSlotError`), and `askUIEventDocWorkspaceClearError` is the way to clear them
- `qpq check:circular` and the rspack circular-check plugin fail by default; `--error`/`QPQ_CIRCULAR_DEPS_ERROR` replaced by `--warn`/`QPQ_CIRCULAR_DEPS_WARN`

## 0.1.9

- eventDoc render route honors `renderMode=published`: renders the version published as of a given time instead of always the full draft log, backed
  by new `askEventDocPublishedVersionAsOf` and `askEventDocEventsAsOf` resolvers
- tenant routes split: the tenant collection stays at `basePath`, membership routes (list mine, create, logo) move to a new `myTenantsBasePath`;
  eventDoc routes gain an `excludeRoutes` option to skip stock endpoints
- web-admin: show basePath in log summary details

### Breaking changes

- the eventDoc render route now throws `NotFound` for `renderMode=published` with nothing published; `EventDocRenderInput` gains a `version` field
- `defineTenant` now requires `myTenantsBasePath`; membership routes move there and stock eventDoc CRUD mounts at `basePath` directly

## 0.1.8

- tenant support: typed `TENANT#`/`PERSONAL#` storage scopes across file, kvs and websockets, an owner-gated tenant registry, and a scoped tenant
  collection
- tenant branding: logo as an uploaded asset ref (with a presigned url route), typed primary/secondary brand colors
- security review sweep across core and webserver: action-typed errors instead of generic ones, cross-tenant scope leak fixes, validator hardening
- streaming event-doc ai chat with tool calling, replacing the old admin log chat
- client-side ai tools: optional executor, halt the turn to ask the user, resumable turns on halt
- typed ai stream finish reasons and a much wider `AiStreamPart` union
- new cli commands: interactive menu for bare `qpq`, `clear-resources` to empty buckets/tables, positional args for `go`/`go:docker`, federated remote
  publish on deploy
- concurrent workspace builds with a multi-lane progress bar and dependency-ordered parallel hooks
- websocket queue and admin log service moved into `quidproquo-features`
- dev server: type watcher, view hot reload, linked package aliasing, per-app runtime scoping
- dev server kvs backend swapped from sqlite to json files
- waf rule action overrides for managed rule groups
- deploy-awscdk: role IAM grants moved to managed policies to dodge the inline policy cap
- module federation expose bundles now split shared chunks
- queue config resolved from qpqConfig instead of env json
- narrower own-code detection in node story traces
- dev process handling: sweep lingering qpq processes before the dev server starts, without killing the caller's own process chain
- deploy-rspack loads markdown imports as raw source
