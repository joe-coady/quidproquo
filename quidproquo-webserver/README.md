# quidproquo-webserver

**WARNING: NOT FOR PRODUCTION**

The `quidproquo-webserver` library is a key component of the quidproquo framework, providing a set of abstractions and utilities for building web applications using the quidproquo architecture. This library serves as the bridge between the core quidproquo functionality and the web server runtime, enabling the execution of quidproquo-based applications on the web.

## Note

Currently under active development and should not be used in production environments. The APIs and functionality are subject to change without notice.

## Key Features

1. **Action-Oriented Architecture**: The `quidproquo-webserver` library aligns with the action-oriented architecture of the quidproquo framework, allowing for the seamless execution of quidproquo actions within the web server environment.

2. **Event Handling**: The library provides specialized action processors for handling various event types, such as HTTP requests, WebSocket events, and more. This enables the integration of quidproquo-based applications with a wide range of web server functionality.

3. **Configuration Management**: The library includes action processors for managing quidproquo configuration, including the retrieval of secrets, parameters, and global values from various sources.

4. **File Management**: The library offers action processors for interacting with the file system, allowing for the reading, writing, and management of files and directories within the quidproquo application.

5. **User Directory Integration**: The library includes action processors for integrating with user authentication and authorization systems, enabling user management and access control within quidproquo-based applications.

6. **Event Bus Integration**: The library provides action processors for publishing and subscribing to events using event bus systems, facilitating cross-service communication and event-driven architectures.

7. **Key-Value Store Integration**: The library includes action processors for interacting with key-value stores, enabling the use of persistent data storage within quidproquo applications.

8. **Logging and Observability**: The library integrates with the quidproquo logging and observability features, ensuring that application logs and metrics are captured and made available for monitoring and troubleshooting.

9. **Extensibility**: The library is designed to be highly extensible, allowing developers to create custom action processors to meet their specific requirements and integrate with a wide range of web server functionality and third-party tools.

## Key Concepts

1. **Action Processors**: Action processors are the core components of the `quidproquo-webserver` library, responsible for executing quidproquo actions within the web server environment. These processors handle the integration with various web server features and ensure the correct execution of quidproquo actions.

2. **Event Handling**: The library provides specialized action processors for handling different event types, such as HTTP requests, WebSocket events, and more. These processors transform the event data into a format that can be consumed by the quidproquo runtime and execute the appropriate quidproquo actions.

3. **Configuration Management**: The library includes action processors for retrieving and managing quidproquo configuration data, such as secrets, parameters, and global values, from various sources.

4. **File Management**: The file management action processors enable the reading, writing, and management of files and directories within the quidproquo application, using the local file system as the underlying storage.

5. **User Directory Integration**: The user directory integration action processors handle the integration with user authentication and authorization systems, allowing for user management and access control within quidproquo-based applications.

6. **Event Bus Integration**: The event bus integration action processors facilitate the publishing and subscribing of events using event bus systems, enabling cross-service communication and event-driven architectures within quidproquo applications.

7. **Key-Value Store Integration**: The key-value store integration action processors provide the ability to interact with key-value stores, allowing quidproquo applications to leverage persistent data storage for their needs.

8. **Logging and Observability**: The library integrates with the quidproquo logging and observability features, ensuring that application logs and metrics are captured and made available for monitoring and troubleshooting.

9. **Extensibility**: The `quidproquo-webserver` library is designed to be highly extensible, allowing developers to create custom action processors to meet their specific requirements and integrate with a wide range of web server functionality and third-party tools.
