/**
 * Local stand-in for a key-value store's change stream.
 *
 * Deployed, DynamoDB emits a change record and Lambda delivers batches of them. There is no
 * such machinery locally, so the KVS backend calls this after a mutating write. Without it
 * `go:dev` would silently stop running stream handlers, and anything that has moved onto a
 * projection (an eventDoc summary, for one) would go stale locally while looking perfectly
 * healthy deployed. A dev server that quietly does less than production is worse than one
 * that does not support the feature at all.
 *
 * Publishes onto the in-process bus rather than invoking the handler directly, for the same
 * reason the queue send processor does: running a handler means running every action
 * processor, and a processor that reaches for that directly would import the whole set,
 * including itself. The bus is what keeps the write path and the handler path apart.
 *
 * Deliberate differences from the deployed path, none of which change the outcome:
 *
 * - ONE record per write. There is no batching, so `coalesceByPartitionKey` has nothing to
 *   collapse and a burst of writes runs the handler once each. Slower, never wrong: handlers
 *   have to be idempotent to survive stream retries anyway.
 * - Keys and images are already raw. The json backend stores items verbatim and partitions by
 *   scope at the FILE level, so there is no composed partition key to take apart the way the
 *   DynamoDB processor must. The scope travels as its own field instead, which lands the
 *   handler in exactly the same shape.
