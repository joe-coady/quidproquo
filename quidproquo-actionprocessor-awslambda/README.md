# quidproquo-actionprocessor-awslambda

The `quidproquo-actionprocessor-awslambda` library is a key component of the quidproquo framework, providing a set of generic action processors for
AWS Lambda. This library serves as the bridge between the core quidproquo functionality and the AWS Lambda runtime, enabling the execution of
quidproquo-based applications on the AWS Lambda platform.

## WARNING: NOT FOR PRODUCTION

**This project is currently under active development and should not be used in production environments. The APIs and functionality are subject to
change without notice.**

## Key Features

1. **Action-Oriented Architecture**: The `quidproquo-actionprocessor-awslambda` library aligns with the action-oriented architecture of the quidproquo
   framework, allowing for the seamless execution of quidproquo actions within the AWS Lambda environment.

2. **Event Handling**: The library provides specialized action processors for handling various event types, such as API Gateway events, CloudFront
   events, SQS events, and more. This enables the integration of quidproquo-based applications with a wide range of AWS services.

3. **Configuration Management**: The library includes action processors for managing quidproquo configuration, including the retrieval of secrets,
   parameters, and global values from AWS services like Secrets Manager and Systems Manager Parameter Store.

4. **File Management**: The library offers action processors for interacting with Amazon S3, allowing for the reading, writing, and management of
   files and directories within the quidproquo application.

5. **User Directory Integration**: The library includes action processors for integrating with Amazon Cognito, enabling user authentication, user
   management, and access control within quidproquo-based applications.

6. **Event Bus Integration**: The library provides action processors for publishing and subscribing to events using Amazon EventBridge, facilitating
   cross-service communication and event-driven architectures.

7. **Key-Value Store Integration**: The library includes action processors for interacting with Amazon DynamoDB, enabling the use of key-value stores
   within quidproquo applications.

8. **Logging and Observability**: The library integrates with the quidproquo logging and observability features, ensuring that application logs and
   metrics are captured and made available for monitoring and troubleshooting.

9. **Extensibility**: The library is designed to be highly extensible, allowing developers to create custom action processors to meet their specific
   requirements.

## Key Concepts

1. **Action Processors**: Action processors are the core components of the `quidproquo-actionprocessor-awslambda` library, responsible for executing
   quidproquo actions within the AWS Lambda environment. These processors handle the integration with various AWS services and ensure the correct
   execution of quidproquo actions.

2. **Event Handling**: The library provides specialized action processors for handling different event types, such as API Gateway events, CloudFront
   events, SQS events, and more. These processors transform the event data into a format that can be consumed by the quidproquo runtime and execute
   the appropriate quidproquo actions.

3. **Configuration Management**: The library includes action processors for retrieving and managing quidproquo configuration data, such as secrets,
   parameters, and global values, from AWS services like Secrets Manager and Systems Manager Parameter Store.

4. **File Management**: The file management action processors enable the reading, writing, and management of files and directories within the
   quidproquo application, using Amazon S3 as the underlying storage service.

5. **User Directory Integration**: The user directory integration action processors handle the integration with Amazon Cognito, allowing for user
   authentication, user management, and access control within quidproquo-based applications.

6. **Event Bus Integration**: The event bus integration action processors facilitate the publishing and subscribing of events using Amazon
   EventBridge, enabling cross-service communication and event-driven architectures within quidproquo applications.

7. **Key-Value Store Integration**: The key-value store integration action processors provide the ability to interact with Amazon DynamoDB, allowing
   quidproquo applications to leverage key-value stores for data storage and retrieval.

8. **Logging and Observability**: The library integrates with the quidproquo logging and observability features, ensuring that application logs and
   metrics are captured and made available for monitoring and troubleshooting.

9. **Extensibility**: The `quidproquo-actionprocessor-awslambda` library is designed to be highly extensible, allowing developers to create custom
   action processors to meet their specific requirements. This enables the integration of quidproquo-based applications with a wide range of AWS
   services and third-party tools.

## Getting Started

To use the `quidproquo-actionprocessor-awslambda` library, you'll need to install the package and its dependencies. You can do this using your
preferred package manager, such as npm or yarn:
